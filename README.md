# Project with Angular for Front End ðŸš€
In this project, the Angular and Angular Material framework was used to create visual components such as cards.
, tables and services. I also used HTML, CSS and Typescript.
Now speaking about what this project is about, it is about renting cars and also renting them.
For each target segment there are different functions according to their needs.
In addition, for the creation of this work an extensive documentation has been created to record
the springs and advances, in the same way the validation of this idea through interviews.

Thank you,

Oscar de la Cruz.
